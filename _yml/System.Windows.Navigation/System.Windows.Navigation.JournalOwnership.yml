  type: Enum
  summary: Specifies whether a  uses its own journal. JournalOwnership is used by the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.JournalOwnership%2A> property.
  remarks: "When JournalOwnership is Automatic, the following behavior applies:  \n  \n-   The hosted <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> behaves as though UsesParentJournal was set if it is hosted by either a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> or a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>.  \n  \n-   The hosted <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> behaves as though OwnsJournal was set if:  \n  \n    -   It is not directly hosted by either a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> or <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>.  \n  \n    -   It is hosted by at least one <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, where each containing <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> has its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.JournalOwnership%2A> property is set to UsesParentJournal.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  once a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> creates its own journal, switching to Automatic has no effect."
  example:
  - "The following example illustrates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> yielding journal management to a host <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>.  \n  \n [!code-xml[FrameJournalOwnershipSnippetSample#SetJournalOwnershipProperty](../../add/codesnippet/Xaml/FrameJournalOwnershipSnippetSample.XAML/HomePage.xaml#setjournalownershipproperty)]"
