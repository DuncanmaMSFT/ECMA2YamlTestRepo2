  summary: References a method to be called when a corresponding asynchronous operation completes.
  remarks: "Use an AsyncCallback delegate to process the results of an asynchronous operation in a separate thread. The AsyncCallback delegate represents a callback method that is called when the asynchronous operation completes. The callback method takes an <xref:System.IAsyncResult> parameter, which is subsequently used to obtain the results of the asynchronous operation.  \n  \n For more information about asynchronous programming, see [Using an AsyncCallback Delegate to End an Asynchronous Operation](../Topic/Using%20an%20AsyncCallback%20Delegate%20to%20End%20an%20Asynchronous%20Operation.md) and [Using an AsyncCallback Delegate and State Object](../Topic/Using%20an%20AsyncCallback%20Delegate%20and%20State%20Object.md) in [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](../Topic/Event-based%20Asynchronous%20Pattern%20\\(EAP\\).md)."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the <xref:System.Net.Dns> class to retrieve Domain Name System (DNS) information for user-specified computers. This example creates an AsyncCallback delegate that references the `ProcessDnsInformation` method. This method is called once for each asynchronous request for DNS information.  \n  \n [!code-cs[AsyncDesignPattern#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.asynccallback_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[AsyncDesignPattern#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.asynccallback_1.vb)]"
