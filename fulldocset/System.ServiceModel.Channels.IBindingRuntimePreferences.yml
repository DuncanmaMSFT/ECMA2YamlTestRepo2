  summary: Defines the optional contract that a binding can implement to specify whether incoming requests are handled synchronously or asynchronously by the service.
  remarks: "In some cases it may be more efficient for a binding to process messages with the synchronous <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel.Receive%2A> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel.Request%2A> methods. A <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding> class can optionally implement IBindingRuntimePreferences to indicate to callers that this is preferred.  \n  \n If a binding does not implement IBindingRuntimePreferences, the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/indigo1-md.md)] Service Model Runtime layer defaults to using the asynchronous versions of the `Receive` and `Request` methods. If a binding does implement IBindingRuntimePreferences, the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/indigo2-md.md)] Service Model Runtime layer checks the value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IBindingRuntimePreferences.ReceiveSynchronously%2A> and uses that to determine whether to call the synchronous versions of the these methods (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel.Receive%2A> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel.Request%2A>) or the asynchronous versions (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel.BeginReceive%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel.EndReceive%28System.IAsyncResult%29> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel.BeginRequest%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel.EndRequest%28System.IAsyncResult%29>. If IBindingRuntimePreferences is implemented by the binding and returns `true` from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IBindingRuntimePreferences.ReceiveSynchronously%2A> property, it is recommended that you use the synchronous <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel.Receive%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel.Request%2A> methods to receive messages from the channel. If the binding does not implement IBindingRuntimePreferences or returns `false` from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IBindingRuntimePreferences.ReceiveSynchronously%2A> property, it is recommended that you use the asynchronous <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel.BeginReceive%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel.EndReceive%28System.IAsyncResult%29> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel.BeginRequest%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel.EndRequest%28System.IAsyncResult%29> methods.  \n  \n Regardless of the value returned by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IBindingRuntimePreferences.ReceiveSynchronously%2A> property, all bindings must still provide valid implementations of both the synchronous and asynchronous versions of the `Receive` methods for the specific channel types implemented. For more information about implementing custom channels, see [Developing Channels](../Topic/Developing%20Channels.md)."

  summary: Gets a value that indicates whether incoming requests can be handled more efficiently synchronously or asynchronously.
  remarks: The standard (system-provided) bindings provided by [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/indigo1-md.md)] have implemented this interface and in some cases override the default value to process incoming messages synchronously.
