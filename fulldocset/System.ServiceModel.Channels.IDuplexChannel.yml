  type: Interface
  summary: Defines the interface that a channel must implement to both send and receive messages.
  remarks: The IDuplexChannel interface is the union of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IOutputChannel> interfaces. The IDuplexChannel interface does not mandate any correlation between the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IOutputChannel> when implemented. This means, in particular, that the contract does not mandate that the sender of messages that are received through the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel> is equal to the recipient of messages sent through the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IOutputChannel>.
