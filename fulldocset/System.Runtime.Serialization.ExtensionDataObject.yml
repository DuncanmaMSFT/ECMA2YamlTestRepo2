  summary: Stores data from a versioned data contract that has been extended by adding new members.
  remarks: The ExtensionDataObject is the structure that stores extra data encountered by the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.XmlObjectSerializer> during deserialization operations. The structure is used by serialization to write the extra data into the serialized instance. The structure is returned by the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.IExtensibleDataObject.ExtensionData%2A> property of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.IExtensibleDataObject> interface.
  example:
  - "The following code serializes an instance of a type (`PersonVersion2`) that is the second version of the serializable type (`Person`). The second version contains extra data (`ID` field) that is not present in the first version. The code then deserializes the XML document into a `Person` object, then immediately reserializes the object including the extra data. Finally, the code deserializes the new XML into a `PersonVersion2` object and writes the complete data to the console, proving that the data has made a round trip to and from an older version of the type. Note that the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute must be applied with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.Name%2A> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.Namespace%2A> properties set to the same name and namespace as the original class.  \n  \n [!code-vb[IUnknownSerializationData#0](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.runtime.seriali_17_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[IUnknownSerializationData#0](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.runtime.seriali_17_1.cs)]"
