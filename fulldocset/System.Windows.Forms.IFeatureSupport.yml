  type: Interface
  summary: Specifies a standard interface for retrieving feature information from the current system.
  remarks: "When implemented in a class, IFeatureSupport provides methods you can use to determine whether a feature is currently installed on the system and to get the version number of a feature. Call <xref:System.Windows.Forms.IFeatureSupport.IsPresent%2A> to determine whether a feature, or a specific version of a feature, is currently installed. Call <xref:System.Windows.Forms.IFeatureSupport.GetVersionPresent%2A> to determine the version number of an installed feature.  \n  \n See the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FeatureSupport> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature> classes for implementations of this interface."
  example:
  - "The following example uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature> implementation of IFeatureSupport and queries for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature.LayeredWindows> feature. The version is checked to see if it is `null`, to determine whether the feature is present. The result is displayed in a text box. This code assumes `textBox1` has been created and placed on a form.  \n  \n [!code-cs[Classic OSFeature Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.i_18_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[Classic OSFeature Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.i_18_1.vb)]\n [!code-cpp[Classic OSFeature Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.i_18_1.cpp)]"
